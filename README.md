# FAF-21X_Team1
For the use of hackathon 18.06.2022, Team 1 from 1st year of FAF

The general idea of the project is to make a pokemon go like application
Where a group of players guess the location of a QR code in a given radius or in a given location
You would use the camera to photo or scan the QR code and it would activate once a given number of 
users scanner the QR code, once the minimal ammount for users is reached the rewards will be given out
to all the people who scanned the QR code.

We settled on Discord Bot server.
